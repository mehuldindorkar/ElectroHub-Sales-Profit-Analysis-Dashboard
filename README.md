# ElectroHub-Sales-Profit-Analysis-Dashboard
Built a Power BI dashboard using the ElectroHub dataset to track sales, profit, quantity sold, discounts, and orders. Shows top/bottom products, sales trends, sales–profit relationship, and period comparisons. Includes average discount, total orders, city-wise sales, and filters for product, date, customer, and promotions.

To understand more details is given below:-

Created a Power BI dashboard to understand how ElectroHub is doing in terms of sales, profit, quantity sold, discounts, and orders.

Identified the top 5 best-selling products and the bottom 5 low-performing products.

Tracked how sales change over time, helping the company spot good and bad months.

Showed the connection between sales and profit, making it easy to see which products actually make money.

Added a feature to compare two different time periods, so users can quickly check growth or decline.

Displayed the average discount given across products.

Included the total number of orders to understand customer demand.

Added a detailed table showing sales, profit, discount, and net sales for each order.

Users can filter the dashboard by product, date, customer ID, or promotion type for deeper analysis.

Also included city-wise sales to find out which cities perform the best.

The project shows my ability to clean data, analyze business performance, and build an interactive dashboard that anyone can understand.
